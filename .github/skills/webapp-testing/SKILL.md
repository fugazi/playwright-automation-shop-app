# Web Application Testing

This skill enables comprehensive testing, debugging, and run browser-based tests for web applications using Playwright automation. It allows you to interact with web pages, verify UI elements, capture screenshots, and inspect console logs to ensure your web application behaves as expected.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Create Playwright tests for web applications
- Test frontend functionality in a real browser
- Verify UI behavior and interactions
- Debug web application issues
- Capture screenshots for documentation or debugging
- Inspect browser console logs
- Validate form submissions and user flows
- Check responsive design across viewports

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on the system
- A locally running web application (or accessible URL)
- Playwright will be installed automatically if not present

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Browser Automation
- Navigate to URLs
- Click buttons and links
- Fill form fields
- Select dropdowns
- Handle dialogs and alerts

### 2. Verification
- Assert element presence
- Verify text content
- Check element visibility
- Validate URLs
- Test responsive behavior

### 3. Debugging
- Capture screenshots
- View console logs
- Inspect network requests
- Debug failed tests

## Usage Examples

### Creating tests

1. Review the [playwright-typescript.instructions.md](.github\instructions\playwright-typescript.instructions.md) for the standard test structure
2. Identify the user flow to test
3. Create a new test file in the `tests/` directory
4. Use Playwright's locators to find elements (prefer role-based selectors)
5. Add assertions to verify expected behavior

### Running tests

To run tests locally:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

### Example 1: Basic Navigation Test
```javascript
// Navigate to a page and verify title
await page.goto('http://localhost:3000');
const title = await page.title();
console.log('Page title:', title);
```

### Example 2: Form Interaction
```javascript
// Fill out and submit a form
await page.fill('#username', 'testuser');
await page.fill('#password', 'password123');
await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
await page.waitForURL('**/dashboard');
```

### Example 3: Screenshot Capture
```javascript
// Capture a screenshot for debugging
await page.screenshot({ path: 'debug.png', fullPage: true });
```

## Guidelines

1. **Always verify the app is running** - Check that the local server is accessible before running tests
2. **Use explicit waits** - Wait for elements or navigation to complete before interacting
3. **Capture screenshots on failure** - Take screenshots to help debug issues
4. **Clean up resources** - Always close the browser when done
5. **Handle timeouts gracefully** - Set reasonable timeouts for slow operations
6. **Test incrementally** - Start with simple interactions before complex flows
7. **Use selectors wisely** - Prefer data-testid or role-based selectors over CSS classes

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Wait for Element
```javascript
await page.waitForSelector('#element-id', { state: 'visible' });
```

### Pattern: Check if Element Exists
```javascript
const exists = await page.locator('#element-id').count() > 0;
```

### Pattern: Get Console Logs
```javascript
page.on('console', msg => console.log('Browser log:', msg.text()));
```

### Pattern: Handle Errors
```javascript
try {
  await page.click('#button');
} catch (error) {
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'error.png' });
  throw error;
}
```

## Limitations

- Requires Node.js environment
- Cannot test native mobile apps (use React Native Testing Library instead)
- May have issues with complex authentication flows
- Some modern frameworks may require specific configuration
